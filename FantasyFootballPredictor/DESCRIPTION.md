# Fantasy-Football-Prediction
This project predicts the top PPR (Points Per Reception) fantasy football players using NFL team and player stats from 2012 to 2023. The data, sourced from Kaggle's [NFL Player Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/philiphyde1/nfl-stats-1999-2022/data?select=offense_yearly_data.csv) and [NFL Team Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nickcantalupa/nfl-team-data-2003-2023), was cleaned and joined in SQL. [FantasyPro's Consensus Rankings](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/adp/ppr-overall) were also integrated to enhance the accuracy of predictions. The model was built and tested in Python, providing a data-driven approach to identifying top fantasy football performers.
