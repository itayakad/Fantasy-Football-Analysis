# Fantasy-Football-Analysis
This project involved building a comprehensive data pipeline using SQL and Python to clean, aggregate, and analyze over ten years of fantasy football player data. By merging datasets across multiple positions, the project calculated breakout scores and identified key performance indicators to highlight potential breakout candidates. Additionally, a Linear Regression model was developed using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn, which improved prediction accuracy for top fantasy football players over the baseline, providing valuable insights for strategic fantasy football decisions.
