# Fantasy-Football-Analysis
This repository contains two different projects, the Breakout Candidate finder and the PPR Totals ranking predictor.

**BreakoutCandidates** is data-driven approach to identifying breakout fantasy football players, utilizing a powerful combination of SQL, Python, and Tableau to deliver actionable insights. SQL was employed to manage, query, and explore comprehensive datasets, allowing for the extraction of key metrics spanning from 2018 to 2023. Python played a minor but crucial role in analyzing this data as it allowed me to compare every player with the metrics I want to find the breakout candidates. Lastly, Tableau was then used to visually display the findings, creating intuitive charts and dashboards that make complex data easily interpretable. By integrating these tools—SQL for data management and exploration, Python for in-depth analysis, and Tableau for visualization—the project not only identifies emerging talents like Jayden Reed and De'Von Achane, but also highlights undervalued veterans like Alvin Kamara and Mark Andrews. Ultimately, this comprehensive approach moves beyond gut instincts, providing fantasy managers with a robust framework to gain a competitive edge and spot the next big breakout stars.
