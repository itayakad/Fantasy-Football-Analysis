# Fantasy-Football-Analysis
This repository contains two different projects, BreakoutCandidates and FantasyFootballPredictor.

**BreakoutCandidates** is data-driven approach to identifying breakout fantasy football players, utilizing a powerful combination of SQL, Python, and Tableau to deliver actionable insights. SQL was employed to manage, query, and explore comprehensive datasets, allowing for the extraction of key metrics spanning from 2018 to 2023. Python played a minor but crucial role in analyzing this data as it allowed me to compare every player with the metrics I want to find the breakout candidates. Lastly, Tableau was then used to visually display the findings, creating intuitive charts and dashboards that make complex data easily interpretable. By integrating these tools—SQL for data management and exploration, Python for in-depth analysis, and Tableau for visualization—the project not only identifies emerging talents like Jayden Reed and De'Von Achane, but also highlights undervalued veterans like Alvin Kamara and Mark Andrews. Ultimately, this comprehensive approach moves beyond gut instincts, providing fantasy managers with a robust framework to gain a competitive edge and spot the next big breakout stars.

**FantasyFootballPrediction** is a sophisticated machine learning project designed to predict the top fantasy football players by combining Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn with extensive SQL-based data processing. The project begins with thorough data cleaning, where irrelevant columns are removed, player names are standardized, and position-specific tables are created to ensure focused analysis. Key performance metrics are normalized, and advanced SQL operations are used to merge player data with team metrics, enhancing the dataset's depth. The cleaned and enriched data is then used to train a Linear Regression model, which leverages statistical features to provide highly accurate player predictions. The project's SQL components also include the creation of control tables for quarterbacks and flex players, with calculated accuracy scores to evaluate the model's performance against historical data. This integrated approach, blending rigorous data preparation with machine learning, results in a powerful tool for fantasy football enthusiasts looking to optimize their lineups and gain a competitive edge.
