# Fantasy-Football-Analysis
This repository contains two different projects, BreakoutCandidates and FantasyFootballPredictor.

**BreakoutCandidates** is data-driven approach to identifying breakout fantasy football players, utilizing a powerful combination of SQL, Python, and Tableau to deliver actionable insights. SQL was employed to manage, query, and explore comprehensive datasets, allowing for the extraction of key metrics spanning from 2018 to 2023. Python played a minor but crucial role in analyzing this data as it allowed me to compare every player with the metrics I want to find the breakout candidates. Lastly, Tableau was then used to visually display the findings, creating intuitive charts and dashboards that make complex data easily interpretable. By integrating these tools—SQL for data management and exploration, Python for in-depth analysis, and Tableau for visualization—the project not only identifies emerging talents like Jayden Reed and De'Von Achane, but also highlights undervalued veterans like Alvin Kamara and Mark Andrews. Ultimately, this comprehensive approach moves beyond gut instincts, providing fantasy managers with a robust framework to gain a competitive edge and spot the next big breakout stars.

**FantasyFootballPrediction** usese machine learning to predict the top fantasy football players, leveraging a Linear Regression model built using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. By focusing on key statistical metrics, the model provides a data-driven approach to player evaluation, moving beyond basic projections to offer more accurate predictions. Through iterative improvements and fine-tuning, the model achieved an approximate 11% improvement over its baseline performance, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach. The use of pandas and numpy facilitated efficient data handling and manipulation, while scikit-learn provided robust tools for model development and evaluation. This combination of Python libraries enabled the creation of a predictive model that not only identifies the best fantasy football players but also enhances decision-making for fantasy managers looking to optimize their lineups. By integrating statistical analysis with machine learning techniques, this project offers a sophisticated tool for gaining a competitive edge in fantasy football.
